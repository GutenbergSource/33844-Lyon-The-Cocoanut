<p class="first">The following pages are written chiefly in the
interests of the planter, but the writer feels that the great
agricultural importance which the cocoanut palm is bound to assume in
these Islands is sufficient to justify the presentation of some of its
history and botany.</p>
<p>For that part of the bulletin which touches upon the botany of the
cocoanut I am indebted to Don Regino Garcia, associate botanist of the
Forestry Bureau; for that relating to its products and local uses, to
the courtesy of manufacturers in Laguna; and, for the rest, to personal
experience and observations made in Laguna Province and in the southern
Visayan Islands where, as elsewhere in this Archipelago, the cocoanut
may properly be considered a spontaneous and not a cultivated
product.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The legendary history of the &ldquo;Prince of
Palms,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e324src" href="#xd27e324" name=
"xd27e324src">1</a> as it has been called, dates back to a period when
the Christian era was young, and its history is developing day by day
in some new and striking manifestation of its utility or beauty. It
seems not unreasonable to assume that much of the earlier traditionary
history of the cocoanut may have been inspired as much by its inherent
beauty as by its uses. Such traditional proverbs Or folklore as I have
gathered in the Visayas recognize the influence of the beautiful, in so
far as the blessings of the trees only inure to the good; for instance,
&ldquo;He who is cruel to his beast or his family will only harvest
barren husks from the reproving trees that witness the pusillanimous
act;&rdquo; and, again, &ldquo;He who grinds the poor will only grind
water instead of fat oil from the meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this day the origin of the cocoanut is unknown. De Candolle
(Origin of Cult. Plants, p. 574) recites twelve specific claims
pointing to an Asiatic origin, and a single, but from a scientific
standpoint almost unanswerable, contention for an American derivation.
None of the remaining nineteen species of the genus Cocos are known to
exist elsewhere in the world than on the American continent. His review
of the story results in the nature of a compromise, assigning to our
own Islands and those to the south and west of us the distinction of
having first given birth to the cocoanut, and that thence it was
disseminated east and west by ocean currents. <span class=

<p>Whether all of these varieties are constant enough to deserve

fruits being distinctly globular, others by fruits of a much prolonged
oval form, still others by having <span class="corr" id="xd27e353"

in a triangular point.</p>
<p>In the Visayas there is a variety in which the fibrous outer husk of
the nut is sweet and watery, instead of dry and astringent, and is
chewed by the natives like sugar cane. Another variety occurs in Luzon,
known as &ldquo;Pamocol,&rdquo; the fruit of which seldom exceeds 20
cm. in diameter. There is also a dwarf variety of the palm, which
rarely exceeds 3 meters in height, and is known to the Tagalogs as
&ldquo;Adiavan.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Copra and Cocoanut Oil.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Until very recent years the demand for the
&ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the cocoanut or its products was limited to the
uses of soap boilers and confectioners. Probably there is no other
plant in the vegetable kingdom which serves so many and so varied
purposes in the domestic economy of the peoples in whose countries it
grows. Within the past decade chemical science has produced from the
cocoanut a series of food products whose manufacture has revolutionized
industry and placed the business of the manufacturer and of the
producer upon a plane of prosperity never before enjoyed.</p>
<p>There has also been a great advance in the processes by which the
new oil derivatives are manufactured. The United States took the
initiative with the first recorded commercial factories in 1895. In
1897 the Germans established factories in Mannheim, but it remained for
the French people to bring the industry to its present perfection.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e372" href="#xd27e372" name=
"xd27e372">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to the latest reports of the American consul at
Marseilles, the conversion of cocoanut oil into dietetic compounds was
undertaken in that city in 1900, by Messrs. Rocca, Tassy and de Roux,
who in that year turned out an average of 25 tons per month. During the
year just closed (1902) their average monthly output exceeded 6,000
tons and, in addition to this, four or five other large factories were
all working together to meet the world&rsquo;s demand for
&ldquo;vegetaline,&rdquo; &ldquo;cocoaline,&rdquo; or other products
with suggestive names, belonging to this infant industry.</p>
<p>These articles are sold at gross price of 18 to 20 cents per kilo to
thrifty Hollandish and Danish merchants, who, at the added cost of a
cent or two, repack them in tins branded &ldquo;Dairy Butter&rdquo;
and, as such, ship them <span class="corr" id="xd27e380" title=
"Not in source">to</span> all parts of the civilized world. It was
necessary to disguise the earlier products by subjecting them to
trituration with milk or cream; but so perfect is the present emulsion
that the plain and unadulterated fats now find as ready a market as
butter. These &ldquo;butters&rdquo; have so far found their readiest
sale in the Tropics.</p>
<p>The significance of these great discoveries to the cocoanut planter
can not be overestimated, for to none of these purely vegetable fats do
the prejudices attach that so long and seriously have handicapped those
derived from animal margarin or margarin in combination with stearic
acid, while the low fusion point of pure dairy butters necessarily
prohibits their use in the Tropics, outside of points equipped with
refrigerating plants. The field, therefore, is practically without
competition, and the question will no longer be that of finding a
market, but of procuring the millions of tons of copra or oil that this
one industry will annually absorb in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Cocoanut oil was once used extensively in the manufacture of fine
candles, and is still occasionally in demand for this purpose in the
Philippines, in combination with the vegetable tallow of a species of
<i>Stillingia</i>. It is largely consumed in lamps, made of a tumbler
or drinking glass half filled with water, on top of which float a few
spoonfuls of oil, into which the wick is plunged. In remote barrios it
is still in general use as a street illuminant, and so perfect is its
combustion that under a constant flicker it emits little or no
smoke.</p>
<p>When freshly expressed, the oil is an exceptionally good cooking
fat, and enters largely into the dietary of our own people. The
medicinal uses of the oil are various, and in the past it has been
strongly advocated for the cure of eczema, burns, as a vermifuge, and
even as a substitute for cod-liver oil in phthisis. Its medicinal
virtues are now generally discredited, except as a restorative agent in
the loss of hair resulting from debilitating fevers. Its value in this
direction may be surmised from the splendid heads of hair possessed by
the Filipino women, who generally use the oil as a hair dressing.</p>
<p>Cocoanut oil is derived from the fleshy albumen or meat of the ripe
fruit, either fresh or dried. The thoroughly dried meat is variously
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e394" href="#xd27e394" name=
"xd27e394">8</a>]</span>known as <i>copra</i>, <i>coprax</i>, and
<i>copraz</i>. The exportation of copra is detrimental to the best
interests of the planter, tending to enrich the manufacturer and
impoverish the grower. The practice, however, is so firmly established
that the writer can only record a probably futile protest against its
continuance.</p>
<p>The causes which for a long time will favor the exportation of copra
instead of oil in this Archipelago may be briefly stated as
follows:</p>
<p>(1) An oil-milling plant, constructed with due regard to economy of
labor and the production of the best quality of oil, would involve an
outlay of capital of $2,500, gold, and upward, according to capacity.
The production of copra requires the labor of the planter&rsquo;s hands
only.</p>
<p>(2) The oil packages must be well-made barrels, casks, or metallic
receptacles. The initial cost of the packages is consequently great,
their return from distant ports impracticable, and their sale value in
the market of delivery is not sufficient to offset the capital locked
up in an unproductive form. On the other hand, copra may be sold or
shipped in boxes, bags, sacks, and bales, or it may even be stored in
bulk in the ship&rsquo;s hold.</p>
<p>(3) When land transportation has to be considered, the lack of good
roads still further impedes the oil maker. He can not change the size
and weight of his packages from day to day to meet the varying
passability of the trail. On the other hand, packages of copra may be
adjusted to meet all emergencies, and the planter can thus take
advantage of the market conditions which may be denied to the oil
maker.</p>
<p>(4) Perhaps the most serious difficulty the oil maker has to contend
with is the continuous discouragement he encounters from the agent of
foreign factories, who buys in the open market and, bidding up to
nearly the full oil value of the copra, finds an ample
manufacturer&rsquo;s profit paid by the press cake, so valuable abroad,
but, unfortunately, practically without sale or value here. The residue
from the mill may be utilized both for food and for manure by the oil
maker who is a tree owner and who maintains cattle. For either of these
purposes its value rates closely up to cotton-seed cake, and the time
is not remote when it will be recognized in the Philippines as far too
valuable a product to be permitted to be removed from the farm
excepting at a price which will permit of the purchase at a less figure
of an equivalent in manure. So active are the copra-buying agents in
controlling this important branch of the industry, that they refuse to
buy the press cake at any price, with the result that, in two instances
known to the writer, they have forced the closure of oil-milling plants
and driven the oil maker back to his copra.</p>

</div>
<p>Many copra-making plants in India and Ceylon are now supplied with
decorticating, breaking, and evaporating machinery. The process
employed in this Archipelago consists in first stripping the ripe fruit
of the outer fibrous husk. This is effected by means of a stout, steel
spearhead, whose shaft or shank is embedded firmly in the soil to such
a depth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e423" href="#xd27e423" name=
"xd27e423">11</a>]</span>that the spear point projects above the ground
rather less than waist high. The operator then holds the nut in his
hands and strikes it upon the spear point, gives it a downward, rotary
twist, and thus, with apparent ease, quickly removes the husk. An
average operator will husk 1,000 nuts per day, and records have been
made of a clean up of as many as 3,000 per day. The work, however, is
exceedingly hard, and involves great dexterity and wrist strength.</p>
<p>Another man now takes up the nut and with a bolo strikes it a smart
blow in the middle, dividing it into two almost equal parts. These
parts are spread out and exposed to the sun for a few hours, or such
time as may be necessary to cause the fleshy albumen to contract and
shrink away from the hard outer shell, so that the meat may be easily
detached with the fingers.</p>
<p>Weather permitting, the meat thus secured is sun dried for a day and
then subjected to the heat of a slow fire for several hours. In some
countries this drying is now effected by hot-air driers, and a very
white and valuable product secured; but in the Philippines the
universal practice is to spread out the copra upon what may be called a
bamboo grill, over a smoky fire made of the shells and husks, just
sufficient heat being maintained not to set fire to the bamboo. The
halves, when dried, are broken by hand into still smaller irregular
fragments, and subjected to one or two days of sun bath. By this time
the moisture has been so thoroughly expelled that the copra is now
ready to be sacked or baled and stored away for shipment or use.</p>
<p>All modern cocoanut-oil mills are supplied with a decorticator armed
with revolving discs that tear or cut through the husk longitudinally,
freeing the nut from its outer covering and leaving the latter in the
best possible condition for the subsequent extraction of its fiber.
This decorticator is fed from a hopper and is made of a size and
capacity to husk from 500 to 1,000 nuts per hour.</p>
<p>Rasping and grinding machinery of many patterns and makes, for
reducing the meat to a pulp, is used in India, Ceylon, and China; and,
although far more expeditious, offers no improvements, so far as
concerns the condition to which the meats are reduced, over the methods
followed in the Philippines. Here the fleshy halves of the meat are
held by hand against a rapidly revolving, half-spherical knife blade
which scrapes and shaves the flesh down to a fine degree of
comminution. The resulting mass is then macerated in a little water and
placed in bags and subjected to pressure, and the milky juice which
flows therefrom is collected in receivers placed below. This is now
drawn off into boilers and cooked until the clear oil is concentrated
upon the surface. The oil is then skimmed off and is ready for
market.</p>
<p>The process outlined above is very wasteful<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e435" title="Not in source">.</span> The processes I have seen in
operation are very inadequate, and I estimate that, not less than 10
per <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e438" href="#xd27e438" name=
"xd27e438">12</a>]</span>cent of the oil goes to loss in the press
cake. This is a loss that does not occur in establishments equipped
with the best hydraulic presses. It is true that very heavy pressure
carries through much coloring matter not withdrawn by the primitive
native mill, and that the oil is consequently darker, and sooner
undergoes decomposition; but modern mills are now supplied with
filtration plants through which this objection is practically
overcome.</p>
<p>The principles of the above process are daily reproduced in
thousands of Filipino homes, where the hand rasping of the nut, the
expression of the milky juice through coarse cloth, its subsequent
boiling down in an open pan, and the final skimming off of the oil are
in <span class="corr" id="xd27e442" title="Source: comon">common</span>
practice. Notwithstanding the cheapness of labor, it is only by
employing a mill well equipped with decorticating, rasping, hydraulic
crushing, and steam-boiling machinery, and with facilities to convert
the residue to feeding or other uses, that one may hopefully enter the
field of oil manufacture in these Islands in competition with copra
buyers.</p>

<p class="first">The fiber of the cocoanut husk, or coir, as it is
commercially known, has never yet been utilized in this Archipelago,
excepting occasionally for local consumption.</p>

<p>Second in value only to the copra, this product has been allowed to
go to waste. The rejected husks are thrown together in immense heaps,
which are finally burned and the ashes, exceedingly rich in potash and
phosphoric acid, are left to blow away.</p>
<p>As the commercial value of the fiber is greater than the manurial
value of the salts therein, it is economy to utilize the fiber and
purchase potash and phosphoric acid when needed to enrich the soil.</p>
<p>Highly improved and inexpensive power machinery for the complete and
easy extraction of the fibers of the husk, either wet or dry, is now
rapidly superseding the tedious hand process once in such general use.
Good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e463" href="#xd27e463" name=

&ldquo;husk-crushing mill<span class="corr" id="xd27e465" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (<a href="#p010">fig. 1</a>) and in the
&ldquo;fiber extractor&rdquo; (<a href="#p011">fig. 2</a>). The first
breaks, crushes, and flattens out the husks by means of powerful,
fluted metal rollers and, in the second the broken husks are fed over a
revolving drum set with teeth especially devised for tearing out the
fiber from the entire mass. Finally, it is fed into one of the many
forms of &ldquo;willowing&rdquo; machines, which reduces the mass to
clean fiber, which is now ready for grading, baling, and shipment. The
residual dust and waste from this operation may be used as an absorbent
for liquid manures, and ultimately returned to the plantation. The
yield of fiber varies from 12 to 25 quintals of coir and 4 to 7
quintals of brush fiber per 10,000 average husks. In the Philippines
the nuts yield a large amount of fiber and a relatively small
percentage of chaff and dust. With improved machinery and careful
handling, 18 quintals of spinning coir and 5 quintals of bristle fiber
from every 10,000 husks is a fair estimate of the product.</p>
<div class="figure p011width" id="p011"><img src="images/p011.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Cocoanut

</div>
<p>As the cost of manufacture is generally rated at one-half the
selling price, and as we must add a further charge of 20 per cent to
cover freight and commission, we have resulting from the sale of the 23
quintals, or 2,300 kilos, at &pound;16 per English ton, a balance of
&pound;11 11s. per hectare.</p>
<p>But there are other considerations which should not be overlooked.
The husks of 10,000 cocoanuts will withdraw from the land 61.5 kilos of
potash and 3 kilos of phosphoric acid, and the restoration of the full
amount is called for to compensate for the growing wants of the tree,
in addition to that withdrawn by the crop. The necessary fertilizers
are worth, approximately, 5&frac12;d. per kilo, making a further
reduction of &pound;1 8s. and leaving as a net profit &pound;10 3s.,
or, reduced to American money, nearly $50, gold, per hectare.</p>
<p>The machines above referred to will cost $800, gold, and $1,200
additional will purchase and house the power necessary to operate them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e487" href="#xd27e487" name=
"xd27e487">14</a>]</span>Such a plant will work up 1,000 nuts a day,
and handle in a year the output of a grove of 30 hectares. With the
addition of two or more fiber extractors the capacity of the plant may
be doubled without material expense, and it should rather more than pay
its entire cost in one year.</p>

<div id="tuba" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Tuba.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tuba is the fresh or mildly fermented sap drawn from
the inflorescence of the cocoanut.</p>
<p>There are no figures or data of any kind available as a basis for an
estimate as to the importance of this product, but its extent may be
inferred from the fact that the outlying groves about Cebu, Iloilo, and
the larger Visayan towns are practically devoted to the production of
tuba, and not to the manufacture of copra.</p>
<p>Tuba is collected from the unexpanded blossoms as soon as they have
fairly pushed through the subtending bracts. To prevent any lateral
expansion, the flowers are tied with strips of the green leaf blade and
then, with a sharp knife, an inch or two of the extreme tip is removed.
The whole flower cluster is now gently pulled forward until it arches
downward. In a day or two the sap begins to drip and is then caught in
a short joint of bamboo, properly secured for the purpose.</p>
<p>As a healthy tree <span class="corr" id="xd27e500" title=
"Source: developes">develops</span> at least one or more flowering
racemes every month, and the flow of sap extends frequently over a
period of two or more months, it is not uncommon <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e503" title="Not in source">to</span> see a number of tubes in use
upon one tree.</p>
<p>The workmen usually visits the tree twice daily to collect
<span class="corr" id="xd27e508" title="Source: the the">the</span>
liquor drawn during the preceding twelve hours in the larger tube,
which he carries upon his back. He slices daily a thin shaving from the
tip of the flower, in order that the wound may be kept open and
bleeding. This process is kept up until nearly all of the flower
cluster has been cut away, or until the sap ceases to flow.</p>
<p>More than a liter a day is sometimes drawn from one tree, and 5
hectoliters is considered a fair annual average from a good bearing
tree.</p>
<p>In its fresh state tuba has a sweetish, slightly astringent taste;
but, as the vessels in which it is collected are rarely cleansed, they
become traps for many varieties of insects, etc., and it is, therefore,
not a very acceptable beverage to a delicate stomach. When purified by
a mild fermentation it is far more palatable.</p>
<p>A secondary fermentation of tuba results in vinegar, and on this
account, chiefly, so much space has been devoted to this feature of the
industry. The vinegar so produced is of good strength and color, of the
highest keeping qualities, and of unrivaled flavor. Its excellence is
so pronounced that upon its inherent merits it would readily find sale
in the world&rsquo;s markets; and, although the local demand for the
tuba now exceeds the production, its conversion into vinegar will
probably prove the more profitable industry in the future. <span class=

<p class="first">In addition to eighty-three utilities described by Mr.
Pereira,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e525src" href="#xd27e525" name=

for:</p>
<p>1. Cocoanut cream. The freshly ground fruit, reduced to a pulp and
strained, is consumed in that form or made into cakes with rice. It
makes a delicious and nutritious food. According to Dr. W. J. Gies, in
experiments lately published,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e530src" href=
"#xd27e530" name="xd27e530src">2</a> its nutritive value is due to 35.4
per cent of oil, about 10 per cent of carbohydrates, and 3 per cent of
protein. The amount of cellulose (fibrous matter) is only 3 per cent,
and its digestibility is easy when the mass, by grating, is reduced to
a fine degree of comminution.</p>
<p>2. The &ldquo;milk&rdquo; or water is used sparingly as a beverage.
It is also fermented and converted into inferior vinegar.</p>
<p>3. The hard shell is used as fuel. When calcined, it produces a
black, lustrous substance, used for dyeing leather.</p>
<p>4. The same shell, aside from many uses quoted by Pereira, is used
here for every conceivable form of cup, ladle, scoop, and spoon.</p>
<p>5. From the tough midrib of the leaf, strong and beautiful baskets
of many designs are made, also excellent and durable brooms, and from
the part where the midrib coalesces with the petiole pot-cleaning
brushes are made.</p>
<p>6. The roots are sometimes used for chewing, as a substitute for
Areca. They also furnish red dyestuff and with one end finely
subdivided may be used in making toothbrushes.</p>
<p>7. The leaves and midribs, when burned, furnish an ash so rich in
potash that it may be used alone in water as a substitute for soap or
when a powerful detergent is required.</p>
<p>8. The fiber of the husk is used extensively by the natives for
calking boats.</p>
<p>9. The milk is used in the preparation of a native dish of rice,
known as &ldquo;casi.&rdquo; It is an excellent and highly prized
dietary article, prepared with rice or in combination with chicken or
locusts.</p>
<p>10. The oil, melted with resins, is an effective and lasting
covering for anything desired to be protected from the ravages of white
ants.</p>
<p>11. The timber is used to bridge streams and bog holes, and the
slowly decaying leaves to fill them up and render them temporarily
passable.</p>
<p>12. The fiber is used in cordage and rope making, but to a far less
extent here than in India. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e556"

<p>Its further uses are, in general, those current in the Orient.
Briefly summed up, its timber is employed in every form of house
construction; its foliage in making mats, sacks, and thatches; its
fruit in curry and sweetmeats; its oil for medicine, cookery, and
illumination; its various juices in the manufacture of wines, spirits,
sugar, and vinegar; while not to overlook a final and not
inconsiderable Filipino product, the splinters of the midrib are used
in making toothpicks.</p>

<h3 class="main">Selection of Location.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the selection of a site for a cocoanut grove it is
best to select land near the seashore and not extending inland more
than 2 or 3 miles. Within this narrow zone there is commonly a deposit
of rich, permeable, well-drained alluvium offering soil conditions of
far greater importance to successful tree growth than the mere exposure
to marine influences. The success that has followed cocoanut growing in
Cochin China, remote from the seaboard, in Annam and up the Ganges
basin one hundred or more miles from the coast, and in our own interior
Province of Laguna, definitely proves that immediate contiguity to the
sea is not essential to success.</p>
<p>That the cocoanut will grow and thrive upon the immediate seashore,
in common with other plants, is simply an indication of its
<span class="corr" id="xd27e569" title=
"Source: adaptibility">adaptability</span> to environment. That it is
at a positive disadvantage as a shore plant may be determined
conclusively by anyone who will examine the root system of a
seashore-grown tree upturned by a wash or tidal wave, and one uprooted
from any cause, farther inland. It will be seen that the root system of
the maritime plant is immensely larger than the other, and that a
corresponding amount of energy has been expended in the search through
much inert material to forage for the necessary plant food which the
more favored inland species has found concentrated within a smaller
zone.</p>
<p>The planting <i>must</i> be made in a thoroughly permeable soil.</p>
<p>The thick, fleshy roots of the newly upturned palm are loaded with
water, and tell us that an inexhaustible store of this fluid is an
indispensable element of success. If further evidence of this were
required, the testimony of drooping leaves and of crops shrunken from
one-half to two-thirds, throughout the cocoanut districts and upon our
own orchard in Mindanao, as the result of drought, confirm it and
bespeak the necessity of copious water at all times.</p>
<p>The living tree upon the sea sands further emphasizes this
necessity; for, while its roots are lapped by the tides, it never flags
<span class="corr" id="xd27e581" title="Source: or or">or</span> wilts,
and from this we may gather the added value of a site which can be
irrigated. The careful observer will note that along miles of sea
beach, among hundreds of trees whose roots are either in actual contact
with the incoming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e584" href=
"#xd27e584" name="xd27e584">17</a>]</span>waves, or subjected to the
subterranean influence of the sea, there will never be so much as one
tree growing in any beach basin which collects and holds tidal water
for even a brief time; and that, notwithstanding the large number of
nuts that must have found lodgment and favorable germinating influence
in such places, none succeed in growing. From this we may derive the
assurance that the desired water must be in motion and that land near
stagnant water, or marsh land, is unsuitable to the plant.</p>
<p>It may frequently be observed that trees will be found growing
fairly thriftily upon mounds or hummocks, in places invaded by flood or
other waters which, by reason of backing or damming up, have become
stagnant. An examination of the roots of an overthrown tree in such a
locality will show that all of those in the submerged zone have
perished and rotted away, but that such is the vitality and
recuperative energy of the tree that it has thrown out a new feeding
system in the dryer soil of the mound immediately surrounding the stem,
which has been sufficient to successfully carry on the functions of
nutrition, but altogether ineffective to anchor the tree securely, or
to prevent its prostration before the first heavy gale.</p>
<p>While this phase of the question will receive more attention when we
come to consider the chemistry of suitable manures, it may be said
that, although analysis of the cocoanut ash derived from beach-grown
nuts shows a larger percentage of those salts that abound in sea water
than those grown inland, yet the equal vigor, vitality, and
fruitfulness of the latter simply confirm the plant&rsquo;s exceptional
adaptability to environment and ability to take up and decompose,
without detriment, the salts of sea or brackish waters. As a victim to
the maritime idea, the writer in 1886 planted, far inland, several
hundred nuts in beds especially devised to reproduce littoral
conditions; shore gravel, sea sand, broken shells, and salt derived
from sea water being used in preparing the seed beds. The starting
growth was unexcelled. Then came a long period of yellowing decline and
almost suspended animation, ultimately followed by a complete
restoration to health and vigor. The early excellent growth was due to
the fact that the first nourishment of the plant is entirely derived
from the endosperm, and careful lifting of the young plants disclosed
the fact that recovery from their moribund condition was, in every
instance, coincident with the time that the roots first succeeded in
working through the unpalatable mess about them into the outlying good,
sweet soil.</p>
<p>The exposure of the plantation is an important consideration, and a
maritime site should be selected in preference to one far inland,
unless it be on an open, unprotected flat, exposed to the influence of
every breeze or the fiercest gales that blow.</p>
<p>The structure of the cocoanut seems well fitted to endure winds of
almost any force, and that a remarkably abundant and strong circulation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e594" href="#xd27e594" name=
"xd27e594">18</a>]</span>of air is essential to its best development is
well shown by comparing a tree subjected to it with the wretched,
spindling specimen growing in a sheltered glen or ravine.</p>
<p>Strong confirmation of this may be found within the artificial
environment of a plant conservatory, where it is feasible to reproduce,
in the minute detail of soil, water, temperature, and humidity, every
essential to its welfare except a good, strong breeze. As a
consequence, the palm languishes and it has long been deemed, on this
account, one of the most rebellious subjects introduced into palm-house
cultivation.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Soil.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The soils for cocoanut growing are best selected by
the process of exclusion. The study of the root development of the palm
will prove to be an unerring guide to proper soil selection.</p>
<p>The roots of monocotyledons, to which great division this palm
belongs, are devoid of the well-defined descending axis, which is
possessed by most tree plants, and is often so strongly developed as to
permit of rock cleavage and the withdrawal of food supplies from great
depths.</p>
<p>The cocoanut has no such provision for its support. Its subterranean
parts are simply a mat-like expanse of thick, fleshy, worm-like
growths, devoid of any feeders other than those provided at the extreme
tips of the relatively few roots. These roots are fleshy (not fibrous)
and can not thrive in any soil through which they may not grow freely
in search of sustenance. It then becomes obvious that stiff, tenacious,
or waxy soils, however rich, are wholly unsuitable. All very heavy
lands, or those that break up into solid, impervious lumps, and,
lastly, any land underlaid near the surface with bed rocks or
impervious clays or conglomerates, are naturally excluded. All other
soils, susceptible of proper drainage, may be considered appropriate to
the growth of the palm. Spons (Encyclop.) advocates light, sandy soils.
Simmonds (Trop. Agric.) names nine different varieties suitable for
this purpose, describing each at tedious length, and laying more or
less emphasis upon a sandy mixture. These might all have been covered
by the single word &ldquo;permeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact every grain of sand in excess of that required
to secure a condition of perfect permeability is a positive
disadvantage and must be paid for by a correspondingly larger area of
cultivation and by future soil amendment. For the rest, the richer and
deeper the soil the less the expense of maintaining soil fertility.</p>
<p>The preparatory work of establishing an orchard is light, provided
the location is not one demanding the opening of drainage canals, and
on lands of good porosity it involves neither subsoiling nor a deeper
plowing than to effectually cover the sod or any minor weed growths
with which it may be covered.</p>
<p>It has long been the reprehensible practice of cocoanut growers to
merely dig pits, manure them, set the plants therein, and permit the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e613" href="#xd27e613" name=
"xd27e613">21</a>]</span>intervening lands (except immediately about
the trees) to run to weeds or jungle.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A group of sprouted nuts.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Philippines the native planter has not yet progressed beyond
the pit stage, nor do his subsequent cultural activities include more
than the occasional &ldquo;boloing&rdquo; of such weeds as threaten to
choke and exterminate the young plants.</p>
<p>Fortunately it will not be long till the force and influence of
example are sure to be felt by our own planters. The progressive German
colonist of Kamerun, German East Africa, and the South Pacific Islands,
as well as the French in Congo and Madagascar, are vigorously
practicing conventional, modern orchard methods in the treatment of
their cocoanut groves, and it is amazing to read of discussions between
Ceylon and Indian nut growers as to the best method of tethering cattle
upon cocoanut palms in pasture, so as to obtain the most benefit from
their excreta.</p>
<p>With an intelligent study of the plant and its characteristics it is
believed that our native planter may put into practical use the
knowledge that the veteran Indian planter has in fifty years failed to
learn or utilize. He will learn that in time the entire superficies of
his orchard will be required by the wide-spreading, surface-feeding
roots of the trees, and that pasture crops of any kind, grown for any
purpose other than soiling or for green manuring, are prejudicial to
future success. He will know that the initial preparation of all of his
orchard and its continuous maintenance in good cultivation are
essential not only to the future welfare of his trees but as a
necessary means in connection with a judicious intermediate crop
rotation.</p>
<p>Hence the preparatory requirements may be summed up as such
preliminary soil breaking as would be required for a corn crop in
similar lands, succeeded by such superficial plowings and cultivations
as would be required to raise a cotton or any other of the so-called
hoed crops.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Seed Selection.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Preliminary to planting the very important question of
<i>seed selection</i> calls for close scrutiny on the planter&rsquo;s
part.</p>
<p>The small native planter is often familiar with the individual
characteristics of his trees. Owners of small estates in Cuyos and
about Zamboanga have pointed out to me trees that have the constant
fruiting habit confirmed, others that will fruit erratically, and
others that flower yet rarely bear fruit. The fruitfulness of the first
class is undoubtedly a result of accidental heredity, for the planter
has in the past made no selection except by chance, nor is the
characteristic in any way due to his cultural system, which consists in
planting the nut and letting nature and heredity do the rest. One tree
in Zamboanga, the owner assured me, had never produced less than 200
nuts annually for fully twenty-three years. Asked as to the bearing of
all of his trees (of which he owned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd27e639" href="#xd27e639" name="xd27e639">22</a>]</span>some three
hundred), he stated that from the lot he averaged 20 nuts at a picking,
five times a year, a total of 100 nuts; that the crop of these was very
fluctuating, some years falling to 60 nuts, again running as high as
130. The especially prized tree did not vary appreciably. In very dry
seasons the nuts shrunk somewhat in size and the copra in weight, but
the yield of nuts never fell below 200, and only once had amounted to
220. He had raised a great number of seedlings, but it had never
occurred to him to select for planting the nuts from that particular
tree.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="planting" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd27e222">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Planting.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have pointed out the necessity of selecting seed
trees of known good bearing habits, and equal care should be exercised
in selecting those the nuts of which are well formed and uniform. This
precaution will suggest itself when one observes that some trees have
the habit of producing a few very large nuts and many of very small and
irregular size and shape, and it is obviously to the planter&rsquo;s
interest to lend no assistance to the propagation and transmission of
such traits. In view of what has been previously stated, it is almost
superfluous earnestly to recommend planters to sow no seeds from young
trees. The principle for this contention&mdash;that no seed should be
selected except from trees of established, well-known fruiting
habits&mdash;would seem to cover the ground effectually.</p>
<p>The best seed should be selected and picked when perfectly mature
and lowered to the ground. The fall from a lofty tree not infrequently
cracks the inner shell, without giving any external evidence of the
injury. A seed so injured will never sprout and therefore is worthless
for seed purposes.</p>
<p>Freshly collected seed nuts contain in the husk more moisture than
is required to effect germination, and if planted in this condition,
decay is apt to set in before germination occurs. To avoid this the
natives tie them in pairs, sling them over bamboo poles where they are
exposed to the air but sheltered from the sun, and leave them until
well sprouted. It is, however, more expeditious to pile the nuts up in
small heaps of eight to ten nuts, in partial shade, where the surface
nuts may be sprinkled occasionally to prevent complete drying out.</p>
<p>Germination is very erratic, sometimes occurring within a month and
sometimes extending over four, five, or more months. When the young
shoot or plumule (see illustration) has fairly thrust its way through
the fibrous husk it is a good practice to go over the heaps and
segregate those that have sprouted, carefully placing them so that the
growing tip be not deformed or distorted by the pressure of
superincumbent nuts. When these sprouts are 30 to 50 cm. high, and a
few roots have thrust through the husk, <i>they are in the best
possible condition for permanent planting</i>.</p>
<p>First. The original preparation of the land should be good and the
surface tilth at the time of planting irreproachable; i. e., free from
weeds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e657" href="#xd27e657" name=
"xd27e657">24</a>]</span>and so mellow that the soil can be closely and
properly pressed around the roots by hand.</p>
<div class="figure p019width"><img src="images/p019.jpg" alt=
"Fig 3.&mdash;Germination of cocoanut." width="485" height="720">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig 3</span>.&mdash;Germination
of cocoanut.</p>
</div>
<p>Second. The orchard should be securely protected from the invasion
of cattle, etc. It is sometimes impossible to protect orchards against
entry of these animals. If the success of these precautions can not be
assured, then the nuts had better be grown in a closely protected
nursery until about a year old, when the albumen of the seed will be
completely assimilated and will therefore no longer attract vermin, and
when the larger size of the plant will give it more protection from
stray cattle.</p>
<p>In either case planting should be made concurrently with the opening
of the rainy monsoon, during which season further field operations will
not be required except when an intermittent, drier period indicates the
advisability of running the cultivator.</p>
<p>The planting &ldquo;pit&rdquo; fetish, in such common use in India,
has nothing to commend it. If stable manures of any kind are available,
a good application at the time of planting will effect wonders in
accelerating the growth of the young plants.</p>
<p>Where the necessary protection is assured, the young seedling
planted out as above recommended should start at once, without check of
any kind, into vigorous growth.</p>
<p>The nursery-grown subject receives an unavoidable setback. Its roots
have been more or less mutilated and, as we may not prune the top
sufficiently to compensate for the root injury, it is generally several
months before the equilibrium of top and root is fully restored. In
most cases, by the end of the second year, it will have been far
outstripped in the growing race by the former.</p>
<p>The history, habits, and characteristics of the cocoanut tree
indicate that it needs a full and free exposure to sun, air, and wind;
and, as it makes a tree, under such circumstances, of wide crown
expansion, these indispensables can not be secured except by very wide
planting.</p>
<p>Conventional recommendations cover all distances, from 5 to 8
meters, with quincunx (i. e., triangular plantings) urged when the
8-meter plan is adopted. But the writer has seen too many groves spaced
at this distance in good soil, with interlacing leaves and badly
spindled in the desperate struggle for light, air, and sun, ever to
recommend the quincunx, or any system other than the square, at
distances not less than 9 meters and, in good soils, preferably 9.5
meters.</p>
<p>The former distance will allow for 123 and the latter 111 trees to
the hectare. They should be lined out with the greatest regularity, so
as to admit at all times of cross plowing and cultivation as
desired.</p>
<p>From this time forward the treatment is one of <i>cultural</i> and
<i>manurial</i> routine.</p>
<p>Annual plowings should not be dispensed with during the life of the
plantation. These plowings may be relatively shallow, sufficient to
cover under the green manures and crops that are made an indispensable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e693" href="#xd27e693" name=
"xd27e693">25</a>]</span>condition to the continued profitable conduct
of the industry. Nothing is to be gained by the removal of the earliest
flowering spikes. Flowering is the congestion of sap at a special point
which, if the grower could control it, he would wish to direct, in the
case of young plants, to the building up of leaf and wood. Cutting the
inflorescence of the cocoanut results in profuse bleeding and, unless
this be checked by the use of a powerful styptic or otherwise, it is
doubtful if the desired end would be accomplished. The earlier crops of
nuts should all be taken with extension cutters or from ladders. No
shoulders for climbing should be cut in any tree, the stem of which has
not become dense, hard, and woody. Cut when the wood is the least bit
succulent, they <span class="corr" id="xd27e695" title=
"Source: becoming">become</span> inviting points of attack for
borers.</p>
<p>With these reservations, there is everything to commend the practice
of shouldering the tree, as offering the safest, most expeditious and
economical way of making it possible to climb and secure the harvest.
It is, of course, understood that the cuts should be made sloping
outward, so as not to collect moisture and invite decay, and no larger
than is strictly necessary for the purpose.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The manuring problem must be met and solved by the
best resources at our command. The writer has had pointed out hundred
of trees that, wholly guiltless of any direct application of manure,
have borne excellent crops for many successive years; but he has also
seen hundreds of others in their very prime, at thirty years, which
once produced a hundred select nuts per year, now producing fluctuating
and uncertain crops of fifteen to thirty inferior fruits.</p>
<p>Time and again native growers have told me of the large and
uniformly continuous crops of nuts from the trees immediately
overshadowing their dwellings and, although some have attributed this
to a sentimental appreciation and gratitude on the part of the palm at
being made one of the family of the owner, a few were sensible enough
to realize that it came of the opportunity that those particular trees
had to get the manurial benefit of the household sewage and waste.</p>
<p>Yet, the lesson is still unlearned and, after much diligent inquiry,
I have yet to find a nut grower in the Philippines who at any time
(except at planting) makes direct and systematic application of manure
to his trees.</p>
<p>In India, Ceylon, the Penang Peninsula, and Cochin China, where the
tree has been cultivated for generations, the most that was ever
attempted until very recently was to throw a little manure in the hole
where the tree was planted, and for all future time to depend on the
inferior, grass-made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e713" href=
"#xd27e713" name="xd27e713">26</a>]</span>droppings of a few cattle
tethered among the trees, to compensate for the half million or more
nuts that a hectare of fairly productive trees should yield during
their normal bearing life.</p>
<p>Upon suitable cocoanut soils&mdash;i. e., those that are light and
permeable&mdash;common salt is positively injurious. In support of this
contention, I will state that salt in solution will break up and freely
combine with lime, making equally soluble chlorids of lime which, of
course, freely leach out in such a soil and carry down to unavailable
depths these salts, invaluable as necessary bases to render assimilable
most plant foods; and that, on this account, commercial manures
containing large amounts of salt, are always to be used with much
discretion, owing to the danger of impoverishing the supply of
necessary lime in the soil.</p>
<p>Finally, so injurious is the direct application of salt to the roots
of most plants that the invariable custom of trained planters (who, for
the sake of the potash contained, are compelled to use crude Stassfurt
mineral manures, which contain large quantities of common salt) is to
apply it a very considerable time before the crop is planted, in order
that this deleterious agent should be well leached and washed away from
the immediate field of root activity.</p>
<p>That the cocoanut is able to take up large quantities of salt may
not be disputed. That the character of its root is such as to enable it
to do so without the injury that would occur to most cultivated plants
I have previously shown, while the history of the cocoanut&rsquo;s
inland career, and the records of agricultural chemistry, both
conclusively point to the fact that its presence is an incident that in
no way contributes to the health, vigor, or fruitfulness of the
tree.</p>
<p>Mr. Cochran&rsquo;s analysis, based upon the unit of 1,000 average
nuts, weighing in the aggregate 3,125 pounds, discloses a drain upon
soil fertility for that number, amounting in round numbers
to&mdash;</p>

<p>Reducing this to crop and area, and taking 60 fruits per annum per
tree as a fair mean for the bearing groves in our cocoanut districts
and on those rare estates where a systematic spacing of about 173 trees

<p>There is an analogy between these four products that makes them all
comparable, in so far as all are largely surface feeders, and, as
experience shows that there can be no continuing success with the last
three that does not include both cultivation and manuring, we may use
the analogy to infer a like indispensable necessity for the successful
issue of the first.</p>
<p>Cultivation as a manurial factor should, therefore, not be
overlooked, and all the more strongly does it become emphasized by the
very difficulties that for some years to come must beset the Philippine
planter in the way of procuring direct manures.</p>
<p>When it comes to the specific application of manures and how to make
the most of our resources, we shall have to turn back to the analysis
of the nut and note that, relatively to other crops, it makes small
demands for nitrogen. At the same time it must not be forgotten that
these chemical determinations only refer to the fruit and that, with
the present incomplete data and lack of investigation of the
constituent parts of root, stem, leaf, and branch, we have nothing to
guide us but what we may infer from the behavior of the plant and its
relationship to plants of long-deferred fruition, whose manurial wants
are well understood.</p>
<p>It is now the most approved orchard practice to encourage an early
development of leaf and branch by the liberal application of nitrogen,
whose stimulant actions upon growth are conceded as the best.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e881" href="#xd27e881" name=
"xd27e881">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>In temperate regions, the exigencies of climate exact that this be
done with discretion and care, in order that the unduly stimulated
growths may be fully ripened and matured against the approach of an
inclement season. In the Tropics no such limitations exist, and the
early growth of the tree may be profitably stimulated to the highest
pitch. That this general treatment, as applied to young fruit trees, is
specifically the one indicated in the early life of the cocoanut, may
be quickly learned by him who will observe the avidity with which the
fleshy roots of a young cocoanut will invade, embrace, and disintegrate
a piece of stable manure.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding lack of chemical analysis, we may not question the
fact that considerable supplies of both potash and phosphoric acid are
withdrawn in the building up of leaf and stem; but these are found in
sufficient quantity in soils of average quality to meet the early
requirements of the plant. It is only when the fruiting age is reached
that demands are made, especially upon the potash, which the planter is
called upon to make good.</p>
<p>Good cultivation, the application of a generous supply of
stimulating nitrogen during its early career, and the gradual
substitution in later life of manures in which potash and phosphoric
acid, particularly the former, predominate, are necessary.</p>
<p>How, then, may we best apply the nitrogen requirements of its early
life? Undoubtedly through the application of abundant supplies of
stable manures, press cakes, tankage, or of such fertilizers as furnish
nitrogen in combination with the large volume of humus necessary to
minister to the gross appetite of the plant under consideration. But
the chances are that none of these are available, and the planter must
have recourse to some of the green, nitrogen-gathering manures that are
always at his command.</p>
<p>He must sow and plow under crops of pease, beans, or other legumes
that will furnish both humus and nitrogen in excess of what they
remove. Incidentally, they will draw heavily upon the potash deposits
of the soil, and they must all be turned back, or, if fed, every kilo
of the resulting manure must be scrupulously returned. He must pay for
the cultivation of the land, for the growing of crops that he turns
back as manure (and that involves further expense for their growing and
plowing under), and, in addition, he must be subject to such outlay for
about seven years before he can begin to realize for the time and labor
expended.</p>
<p>But there are expedients to which the planter may have recourse
which, if utilized, may return every dollar of cultural outlay. By the
use of a wise rotation he can not only maintain his land in a good
productive condition but realize a good biennial crop that will keep
the plantation from being a financial drag. The rotation that occurs to
me as most promising on the average cocoanut lands of these Islands
would be, first, a green manure crop, followed by corn and legumes,
succeeded by cotton, and then back to green manures. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e895" href="#xd27e895" name=
"xd27e895">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>To make the first green crop effective as a manure, both lime and
potash are essential&mdash;the former to make available the nitrogen we
hope to gather, and the potash in order to secure the largest and
quickest growth of the pulse we are to raise for manurial purposes.</p>
<p>Both these elements are generally in good supply in our cocoanut
lands; but, if there is uncertainty upon this point, both should be
supplied, in some form. Fortunately, the former is cheap and abundant
in most parts of the Archipelago, and, when well slaked, may be freely
applied with benefit, at the rate of a ton or even more to the
hectare.</p>
<p>In default of the mineral potash salts, the grower must seek
unleached wood ashes, either by burning his own unused jungle land to
procure them or by purchasing them from the neighbor who has such land
to burn over. If located on the littoral, he will carefully collect all
the seaweed that is blown in, although in our tropical waters the huge
and abundant marine alg&aelig; are mostly lacking. Such as are found,
however, furnish a not inconsiderable amount of potash, and, in the
extremities to which planters remote from commercial centers are
driven, no source is too inconsiderable to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The first green crop selected will be one <i>known</i> to be of
tropical origin which, with fair soil conditions, will not fail to give
a good yield. He may with safety try any of the native rank-growing
beans, or cowpeas, soja, or velvet beans; or, if these are not
procurable, he has at command everywhere an unstinted seed supply of
<i>Cajanus indicus</i>, or of <i>Clitorea ternatea</i>, which will as
well effect the desired end&mdash;to wit, a great volume of humus and a
new soil supply of nitrogen. It remains for the planter to determine if
the crop thus grown is to be plowed under, or if he will use it to
still better advantage by partially feeding it, subject, as previously
stated, to an honest return to the land of all the manure resulting
therefrom.</p>
<p>He may utilize it in any way, even to selling the resulting seed
crop, provided all the remaining brush is turned back to the land and a
portion of the money he receives for the seed be reinvested in
high-grade potash and phosphatic manures. The plantation should now be
in fair condition for a corn crop, and, as a very slight shading is not
prejudicial to the young palms, the corn can be planted close enough to
the trees, leaving only sufficient space to admit of the free
cultivation that both require.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that corn makes the most serious inroads
upon our soil fertility of any of the crops in our rotation, and,
unless by this time the planter is prepared to feed all the grain
produced to fatten swine or cattle, it had better be eliminated from
the rotation and peanuts substituted. In addition to this, he must
still make good whatever drains the corn will have made upon this
element of soil fertility.</p>
<p>Cropping to corn attacks the cocoanut at a new and vulnerable point,
against which the careful grower must make provision. It will be
remembered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e919" href="#xd27e919"
name="xd27e919">30</a>]</span>that an average corn crop makes very
considerable drafts upon the soil supply of phosphoric acid; but, if
the grain is used for fattening swine, whose manure is much richer in
phosphates than most farm manures, and the latter is restored to the
land, serious soil impoverishment may be averted.</p>
<p>The next step in our suggested rotation is the cotton crop. Here,
too, limitations are imposed upon the planter who is without abundant
manurial resources to maintain the future integrity of his grove. He
may sell the lint from his cotton, but he can not dispose of it (as is
frequently done here) in the seed.</p>
<p>If the enterprise be not upon a scale that will justify the
equipment of a mill and the manufacture of the oil, he has no
alternative but to return the seed in lieu of the seed cake, wasteful
and extravagant though such a process be.</p>
<p>The oil so returned is without manurial value and, if left in the
seed, is so much money wasted. The rational process, of course, calls
for the return of the press cake, either direct or in the form of
manure after it has been fed. With this is also secured the hull, rich
in both the potash and the phosphoric acid<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e928src" href="#xd27e928" name="xd27e928src">3</a> which we now
know is so essential to the future welfare of the grove.</p>
<p>The above rotation is simply suggested as a tentative expedient.</p>
<p>The ground will now be so shaded that we can not hope to raise more
catch crops for harvesting, although it may be possible during the dry
season to raise a partial stand of pulses, of manure value only; but,
from the fruiting stage on, this becomes a minor consideration.</p>
<p>This stage of the cultural story brings us once more face to face
with the principle contended for at the beginning of this paper,
namely, that there can be no permanent prosperity in this branch of
horticulture until the crop is so worked up into its ultimate products
that none of the residue of manufacture goes to waste.</p>
<p>At best the return of these side products is insufficient, and,
despite their careful husbandry, we can not ultimately evade a greater
or less resort to inorganic manures of high cost and difficult
procurement.</p>
<p>The residue from the press cake is rich in nitrogen and humus,
which, in the ever-increasing shade of the grove, will become more and
more difficult to produce there through nitrogen-making agencies; but
the waste from the manufacture of coir and the ashes from the woody
shell will go far toward supplying the needed potash.</p>
<p>Such a system would, if closely followed, practically restrict the
farmer&rsquo;s ultimate purchases to a small quantity of acid
phosphates, or of bone dust, which, in conjunction with good tillage,
should serve to maintain the grove in a highly productive condition for
an indefinite term of years. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e943"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Irrigation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As an auxiliary manurial agent of definite,
well-proven value in this Archipelago, I will briefly recite some of
the benefits that may be expected to follow occasional irrigation
during the dry season.</p>
<p>It strongly accelerates growth and early maturity. A few irrigated
trees, reputed to be under five years from seed and already bearing
fruit, were shown the writer on the Island of Jol&oacute;. The growth
was remarkably strong and vigorous, notwithstanding that the water of
irrigation had been applied in such a way that the tree could only hope
to derive a minimum of benefit from its application. It had merely been
turned on from a convenient ditch whenever the soil seemed baked and
dry, at intervals of one to three weeks, as circumstances seemed to
require.</p>
<p>Irrigation, but always in connection with subsequent cultivation,
may be considered equal to a crop guaranty that is not afforded so
effectually by any purely cultural system.</p>
<p>Rarely has a better opportunity occurred to demonstrate the
unquestioned benefits that have inured to these few Jol&oacute; trees
from the use of irrigating waters than the present season of
1902&ndash;3. From many sources reports come to this Bureau of trees
failing, or dying outright, from lack of moisture. While it is true
that the present dry season has had no parallel since 1885&ndash;86,
and that the rainfall during the dry season has been less than half the
normal, yet it should not be forgotten that, during the eight months
from October to May, inclusive, the average precipitation on the west
coast, at the latitude of Manila, is only about 460 mm. and that, when
the amount falls below this, the cocoanut is bound to suffer.</p>
<p>Though it is true that the evil effects of drought may be modified,
if not altogether controlled, by cultivation, the assistance of
irrigation places the cultivator in an impregnable position. If
evidence in support of this statement were called for, it might be
found to-day in the deplorable condition of those groves that have been
permitted to run to pasture, as compared with those in which some
attempts have been made to bolo out the encroaching weeds and
grasses.</p>
<p>It is probably true that, except on very sandy soils, continued
surface irrigation would aggravate the superficial root-developing
tendency of the tree; and to what extent, if any, occasional laceration
by deep shovel tooth cultivation would injure the tree remains to be
seen. There are, however, few economic plants that so quickly repair
root damage as the Palm&aelig;, and, unless the seat of injury extends
over a very large area, it is probable that the resulting injury would
be of no consequence, as compared with the <span class="corr" id=

result from irrigation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e962" href=

<h2 class="main">Harvest.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Harvest of the crop requires but a brief discussion.
The nuts should be plucked when ripe. The phenomenon of maturity can
not be readily described in print. It frequently is as evident in nuts
of a bright green color as in those of a golden-yellow color, and the
recognition is one of those things that can only be learned by
experience.</p>
<p>The practice, so general in the Seychelles, of allowing the nut to
hang till it falls to the ground is certainly undesirable in these
Islands. On the contrary, the overripe nuts will seldom fall until
dislodged by a storm, and it is no uncommon thing to see nuts that have
sprouted and started to grow upon trees in plantations where the
harvest is left to the action of natural causes. Such nuts, of course,
are entirely worthless for the manufacture of oil or copra, and even
the husk has depreciated in value, the finest coirs, in fact, being
derived only from the fruits that have not attained full ripeness. In
any case, the nuts should be picked and the crop worked up before any
considerable enlargement or swelling of the embryo occurs. From this
time onward physiological changes arise which injuriously affect the
quantity and quality of what is called the meat.</p>
<p>The heaping up of the nuts for some time after harvest favors some
milk absorption, which seems to facilitate the subsequent easy
extraction of the endosperm.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="enemies" class="div1 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd27e249">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Enemies.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Outside of certain insects of the order Coleoptera,
cocoanuts in the Philippines are reasonably free from enemies; in some
districts, close to forest-clad areas, the raids of monkeys do some
damage. A tree-nesting rat, which nibbles the young nuts, is also a
source of considerable loss. The rat is best overcome by frequent
disturbance of his quarters. This involves the removal of the dead
leaves and thatch that form constantly about the base of the crown. But
the wisdom of this recommendation will depend entirely upon
circumstances. As the planter may find that rats or the rhinoceros
beetle are the lesser evil, so should he be governed.</p>
<p>There are localities in the Archipelago where the plague of rats is
unknown and where the beetles abound. In that case it would be unwise
to disturb the leaves which are very tardily deciduous and do not
naturally fall till the wood beneath is hard, mature, and practically
impervious to the attacks of insects.</p>
<p>Where rats are numerous and insects few, which is the case in some
localities, the dead and dying leaves, among which the rat nests, may
be advantageously cleared away whenever the tree is climbed to harvest
the fruit.</p>
<p>Among serious insect enemies we have to contend largely with the
very obnoxious black beetle, <i>Oryctes rhinocerus</i>, and,
fortunately, to a lesser extent, with <i>Rhynchoporus ferrugineous</i>
(probably the same as <i>R. ochreatus</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd27e992" href="#xd27e992" name="xd27e992">33</a>]</span>of Eydoux),
while <i>R. pascha</i>, Boehm, and <i>Chalcosma atlas</i>, Linn., are
also said to appear occasionally.</p>
<p>However different their mode of attack, the general result is the
same, and their presence may surely be detected by the appearance of
deformed or badly misshapen or lacerated leaves.</p>
<p>The attacks of all species are confined to the growing point and as
far downward as the wood is tender and susceptible to the action of
their powerful mandibles.</p>
<p>The black beetle makes its attacks when fully mature, eating its way
into the soft tissues and generally selecting the axil of a young leaf
as the point of least resistance. Others simply deposit their eggs,
which hatch out, and the resulting grub is provided with jaws powerful
enough to do the same mischief. Two or three of these grubs, if
undisturbed, are sufficient in time to completely riddle the growing
tip, which then falls over and the tree necessarily dies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="remedies" class="div1 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd27e255">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Remedies.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Remedies may be described as preventive and
aggressive, and, by an active campaign of precaution, many subsequent
remedial applications can be avoided.</p>
<p>Most of the beetles attacking the palm are known to select heaps of
decomposing rubbish and manure as their favorite (if not necessary)
breeding places, and it is obviously of importance to break up and
destroy such; nor can any better or more advantageous way of effecting
this be suggested than by promptly spreading and plowing under all such
accumulations as fast as they are made; or, if this be impracticable,
by forking or turning over or otherwise disturbing the heaps, until
convenient to dispose of them as first suggested.</p>
<p>A truly preventive and simple remedy, and one that I can commend as
a result of close observation, is the application of a handful or two
of sharp, coarse, clean sand in the axill&aelig; of the young leaves.
The native practice is to mix this with ashes, salt, or tobacco dust;
but it is questionable if the efficacy of the remedy lies so much in
these additions as in the purely mechanical effect of the sand, the
constant attrition of which can not be other than highly objectionable
to the insect while burrowing.</p>
<p>Of offensive remedies, probing with a stout hooked wire is the only
form of warfare carried on in these Islands; but, as the channel of the
borer is sometimes tortuous and deep, this is not always effective. A
certain, simple, and easily applied remedy may be found in carbon
bisulphid. It could be applied in the holes (which invariably trend
downward) with a small metal syringe. The hole should be sealed
immediately with a pinch of stiff, moist clay.</p>
<p>It is likely that this remedy and probing with a wire are the only
successful ways of combatting the red beetle, whose grub strikes in
wherever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e1020" href="#xd27e1020"
name="xd27e1020">34</a>]</span>it finds a soft spot; but, for these
species which attack the axils of the leaves, I have great faith in the
efficacy of the &ldquo;sand cure,&rdquo; and no nut picker should go
aloft unprovided with a small bamboo tube of dry, sifted sand, to
protect the bases of recently expanded leaves.</p>
<p>In Selangor cocoanut trees now come under the government inspection,
and planters and owners, under penalties, are compelled to destroy
these pests. Mr. L. C. Brown, of Kuala Lampur, in that State, who
writes intelligently on this subject,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1024src" href="#xd27e1024" name="xd27e1024src">1</a> lays great
stress on the value of clean cultivation in subduing beetles, and
repeats a cultural axiom that never grows old and that will,
consequently, bear reiteration here&mdash;that it is rarely anything
but the neglected plantation that suffers, and that the maintenance at
all times of a healthy, vigorous growth is in itself almost a guaranty
of immunity from attacks of these pernicious insects.</p>
<p>While we, unfortunately, know that this is not in all cases an
assured protection against diseases or insect enemies, it certainly
minimizes the danger and, in itself, is a justification of the
high-pressure cultural treatment advocated throughout the preceding
pages.</p>

<p class="first">Material improvement of old plantations may sometimes
be effected and, unless the trees are known to be upward of fifty years
old, generally repays the labor. Marked increase in crop has followed a
heavy thinning out of trees upon the Government cocoanut farm at San
Ramon, Mindanao. The improvement that a freer circulation of air and
abundant sunlight have effected is very marked. Where it can be done,
plowing is also sometimes feasible and should be followed by immediate
crop improvement. The average native plow is not so well adapted for
working over an old or neglected grove as it is for original soil
preparation. It acts more as a subsoiler and will tear and lacerate
more roots than is desirable. A single carabao, or one-horse American
garden plow, is the better implement for this work. Extensive bat guano
deposits are found in Mindoro, Guimar&aacute;s, and Luzon. Some of them
show richness in nitrogen and, when accessible at a moderate cost,
would be useful in the renovation of old groves, where the shade would
be adverse to the rearing of good crops of nitrogen gatherers.</p>

<h2 class="main">Conclusion.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. There are large areas throughout the littoral
valleys of the Archipelago, as yet unexploited, which, in the
essentials of soil, climate, irrigation facilities, and general
environment are suitable for cocoanut growing.</p>
<p>2. The present conditions present especially flattering attractions
to cocoanut growers capable of undertaking the cultivation upon a scale
of some magnitude. By co&ouml;peration, small estates could combine in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e1041" href="#xd27e1041" name=
"xd27e1041">35</a>]</span>common ownership of machinery, whereby the
products of the grove could be converted into more profitable
substances than copra.</p>
<p>3. The present production of copra (estimated at 278,000 piculs in
1902) is an assurance of a sufficient supply to warrant the erection of
a high-class modern plant for the manufacture of the ultimate (the
&ldquo;butter&rdquo;) products of the nut. The products of such an
enterprise would be increased by the certainty of a local market in the
Philippines for some part of the output. The average market value of
the best grades of copra in the Marseilles market is $54.40, gold, per
English ton. The jobbing value on January 1 of this year, of the

<p>the difference representing the profit per ton, less the cost of
manufacture.</p>
<p>4. The minimum size of a plantation, on which economical application
of oil and fiber preparing machinery could be made, is 60 hectares.</p>
<p>5. There is no other horticultural tropical product which may be
grown in these Islands where crop assurance may be so nearly
guaranteed, or natural conditions so nearly controlled by the planter
who, knowing correct principles, has the facilities for applying
them.</p>
<p>6. The natural enemies and diseases of the plant are relatively few,
easily held in check by vigilance and the exercise of competent
business management.</p>
<p>7. The labor situation is bound more seriously to affect the small
planter, wholly dependent upon hand labor, than the estate conducted on
a large enough scale to justify the employment of modern machinery.</p>
<p>8. In view of an ever-expanding demand for cocoanut products, and in
the light of the foregoing conclusions, the industry, when prosecuted
upon a considerable scale and subject to the requirements previously
set forth, promises for many years to be one of the most profitable and
desirable enterprises which command the attention of the Filipino
planter.</p>
<p>The greatest mine of horticultural wealth which is open to the
shrewd planter lies in the heaps of waste and neglected husks that he
can now procure from adjoining estates for the asking and cartage.</p>
<p>With labor at 1 peso per diem and at the present price of potash and
phosphoric acid, all the husks in excess of 300 per diem which could be
hauled would be clear profit. The ashes of these, when burned and
applied to the old grove, would have an immediate and revivifying
influence.</p>
<p>Many trees in an old plantation have ceased to bear. Whether this is
due to exhaustion from old age or from soil exhaustion is immaterial;
each should be eradicated and the time-honored custom of replanting a
fresh tree in its place abandoned. These renewals are difficult enough
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e1088" href="#xd27e1088" name=

scientific cultural conditions have been of the best. Renewals in a
cocoanut grove, unless the vacant space is abnormally large and can be
subjected to some years of soil improvement, are unprofitable.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of opinion as to the bearing life of a
cocoanut tree. It is said to vary from thirty to one hundred and thirty
years. Grown more than forty, or possibly fifty years old, the writer
would hesitate to undertake the improvement or renewal of the
grove.</p>
<p>Palms, unlike exogenous trees, afford no evidence by which their age
may be determined. In general, with advanced years, come great height
and great attenuation. In the open, and where fully exposed to
atmospheric influences, these form an approximate criterion of age. The
so-called annular scars, marking the earlier attachments of leaves,
furnish no clue to age.</p>
